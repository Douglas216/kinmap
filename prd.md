# Product Requirement Document

The fundamental feature of KinMap is to breakdown the relationship between me and members of my extended family. Members will be represented as nodes in a network map and their relationhip will be represented as edges. All the complicated and ambiguous terms in a Chinese family tree will be broken down into only father, mother, husband, wife, brother, and sister.

Each node is displayed as their Chinese name, but users should also be able to add their English name, nickname, current location, and additional remarks.
